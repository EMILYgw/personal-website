**THE HALLOWEEN TREE - Ray Bradbury**

Ray Bradbury is not just *Fahrenheit 451* or *The Martian Chronicles*, and this (lesser-known, if not completely obscure) book is a perfect example! I admit that at first I was hesitant, and I will explain why, but it is towards the end that you truly grasp the essence of the entire story, reevaluating every single word you read before. I also find it quite hard to convey what it made me feel, as well as what the author wanted to express. Even categorizing it is complicated. Is it a mystery? A horror? A fantasy? None of the above! It is a deep reflection on the meaning of life, its fleeting nature, and death, which presents itself the same way to all human beings, without differences of time or place. Death here remains unchanged; what was is what will be.

But without further delay, let’s embark on our journey.  
Geronimo!

On Halloween night, a group of kids in costume is ready to cause mischief, but one is missing! Pipkin, the ninth member of the gang, is nowhere to be found. This is where the adventure begins, or rather, at the house and the tree covered with smiling pumpkins where they had agreed to meet. With a rather peculiar guide, they travel through time and space: from prehistoric caves to ancient Egypt, from the dark Middle Ages to Celtic druids, from Greece to Rome, from the spires of Notre Dame down to Mexico. In every place and era, the children discover the meaning of their costumes and the fear that unites every being through time and space: death. They fly on a kite, on brooms, and are carried by the wind in pursuit of Pipkin. Will they manage to save him?

This story not only explains the origins of Halloween, its history, and its various celebrations (all symbolized by the great tree with its pumpkins), but it is also a metaphor centered on the importance of being alive.

*The Halloween Tree* is a gothic autumn, a cold and long journey towards sunset.

Despite your first impression, which might lead you to think this book is just a spooky story for kids, I *strongly urge* you to finish it quickly! One page will pull you into the next, and before you know it, you’ll be caught and enveloped in Bradbury’s melancholy. Let yourself be carried by the wind and fly with these eight magnificent children in search of Pipkin!
