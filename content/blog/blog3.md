**YESTERDAY - Agota Kristof**

Second reading and second title by Agota Kristof (my first encounter with this great writer was *The Notebook Trilogy*). Even before starting, I had high expectations—my previous experience with her was both astonishing and heartbreaking. Her books are metaphors that hide a sad, dark, and gray reality, not always easy to accept.

But enough chatter!  
Let’s dive in!

Tobias: an emigrant, bored, defeated, and overwhelmed by life. Every day he feels crushed by his duties, from which he wishes to escape but cannot. The need to survive, to stay afloat after a life of misery, sweeps away even his attempts to drown in the mud (which will lead him to psychiatric wards, triggering a series of painful memories).

It is precisely from his past, which he tries in vain to escape after staining himself with his parents' blood, that the need arises to lie without scruples, to write as a refuge from the emptiness around him, and to wait for a woman who never really existed, except in his mind: Line. This woman was not just a figment of his imagination, but a ghost from the past—his stepsister. With her arrival, Tobias unleashes his obsession, curiosity, and nostalgia toward this person who resurfaced like a memory. From here blooms an impossible, sick love that transforms the man’s burdens into pleasures, and his strange tales into poetry.

However, the past cannot be erased, and it will lead him to repeat the same mistakes and crimes that forced him to flee his homeland.

A raw, real love story without a happy ending. A possible tomorrow, but one that cannot be realized; and what remains is nothing but yesterday.

A book to be devoured in one sitting, one that will leave a knot in your throat, steal some tears, and make you long for a love like this (real, though painful).

Dear Kristof, you will return to my hands with new words, and I am certain you will not disappoint me.
