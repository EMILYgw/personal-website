**THE CROW - James O' Barr**

Okay, things are getting complicated. This time I’m biased, but I promise I’ll try to be as objective as possible, even though it’s hard not to get carried away by the rushing river that this graphic novel is! I risk boring you, overpraising, and being long-winded, so please forgive me—I warned you in advance: if you don’t want to get sucked into my very own whirlwind of obsession, stop reading here!

Let’s not waste any more time, here’s my take.  
Geronimo!

Deeply influenced by his personal experience, James O’Barr channels all his pain into this work. A man returns from the realm of the dead to take revenge on a gang of criminals who had beaten and killed him along with his girlfriend. He remains alive not only because of his thirst for vengeance but also due to a supernatural presence, embodied by a crow, which accompanies him throughout the story. It is this crow that keeps him tethered to the world of the living and grants him immortality. Suffering, pain, and all the love for his lost woman drive him to commit ruthless murders. Thus, the protagonist dons the role of the angel of death, a merciless antihero determined to eliminate the guilty. Only after completing his mission will he be able to return to the realm of the dead and reunite with his beloved, for eternity.

A story that cuts deep to the bone, capable of exposing even the hardest soul and coldest heart. A tale of love, revenge, and suffering. A dream where one can find what has been lost, face pain and loneliness, and deliver justice to what is anything but just... because the only way to forgive is to forgive oneself.
