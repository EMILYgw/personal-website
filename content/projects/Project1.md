## Project Overview

This project focuses on the task of Cross-Genre Gender Prediction in Italian, as part of the EVALITA 2018 evaluation campaign. It explores several classification approaches including:

- **SVM with non-lexical linguistic features**
- **SVM with character, word, lemma, and POS n-grams**  
- **SVM with word embeddings**  
- **Neural language model based on BERT**

The goal is to identify the author's gender across different genres of Italian texts by leveraging lexical, syntactic, and semantic features.
