## Project Overview

*Il Rifugio dei Lettori* is an interactive and accessible website created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, developed as part of a university assignment. The website is entirely in Italian and is dedicated to literature enthusiasts.

The site includes multiple themed sections:

- **Recensioni** – user-written book reviews  
- **Notizie** – a curated feed of literary news  
- **Quiz & Puzzle** – interactive games for book lovers  
- **Anagrammi** – a game to guess book titles from scrambled letters  
- **Info** – a section about the author and project purpose

Images and external content (e.g., news) are credited appropriately, and the website follows W3C standards for accessibility and validation.

This project highlights the integration of static web technologies to create a cohesive, multi-page literary experience.
