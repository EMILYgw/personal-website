## Project Overview

*The Readers' Refuge* is an interactive and accessible website created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, developed as part of a university assignment. The website is entirely in Italian and is dedicated to literature enthusiasts.

The site includes multiple themed sections:

- **Reviews** – user-written book reviews  
- **News** – a curated feed of literary updates  
- **Quiz & Puzzle** – interactive games for book lovers  
- **Anagrams** – a game to guess book titles from scrambled letters  
- **Info** – a section about the author and the purpose of the project

Images and external content (e.g., news feeds) are properly credited, and the website adheres to W3C standards for accessibility and validation.

This project showcases the integration of static web technologies to create a cohesive, multi-page literary experience.
