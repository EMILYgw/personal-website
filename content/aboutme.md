## 👋 Hey there! I'm Emily

Right after high school, I had *zero* idea what to do with my life. Being super indecisive, I started working in a bookstore — basically my happy place. After a year of flipping pages and chatting about books, I realized I actually loved it and decided to study Literature at university while still working and reading like a maniac. Anime, series, movies — you name it, I was there!

### 📚 Finding my path

By summer 2023, when I was about to finish my bachelor's degree, I felt like something was missing. I loved what I had studied, but it wasn’t enough. So, in August 2023, with a bittersweet feeling, I left my beloved bookstore job and moved to Pisa in September to start my Master's in Digital Humanities and Computer Science.

### 💻 Diving into a new world

My first encounter with computer science was pretty basic — I barely knew how to use a PC! My first university project was a simple website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (not my best work, honestly), themed all around books with reviews and little bookish games. But it was a great start!

As months passed and exams piled up, I began to see my path more clearly: Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence caught my attention big time. I dove into computational models, studied their history, and worked on university projects involving language models like BERT. And guess what? I actually started to enjoy it!

### 🔍 Exploring new passions

I also took courses in data mining, where I got to create classifiers and clusters — super exciting stuff. Though things are still a bit fuzzy sometimes, I know I have a lot to learn, and I’m ready for it. I’m young and determined, and I’ll keep pushing forward, never forgetting my lifelong love for books.

### 💼 Work & hustle

Oh, and while all this was happening, I also found a part-time gig as a LinkedIn Operator — a cool side job that helps me pay for my studies. Managing LinkedIn profiles and supporting B2B clients keeps me busy and sharp!
